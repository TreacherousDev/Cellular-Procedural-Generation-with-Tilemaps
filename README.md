# Using this Resource
1. Create a TreacherousMapManager instance. This component will be responsible for managing the generator scripts that we have.

2. Select the type of generator you want the script to run. YOu can select the default base generator, or the more advanced ones like rooms, caves and mazes. These advanced scripts have built-in support for additional functionalities.

3. Select a tileset to render your rooms. There are default presets included in the source code, but you can create your own tileset as long as it follows the correct atlas coordinate layout.

4. Save the current scene and run it to test if it is working correctly. You may need to attach a Camera2D node as a child to adjust the view of the map.
